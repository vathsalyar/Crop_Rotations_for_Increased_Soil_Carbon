# Crop Rotations for Increased Soil Carbon

## Overview
This project explores crop rotation strategies and their effect on soil carbon using Python.  
The analysis is done in Jupyter Notebook with data visualization and mapping.

## Files
- `CropRotationsforIncreasedSoilCarbon.ipynb` — Main notebook with the code and analysis.
- `requirements.txt` — Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## Dataset
